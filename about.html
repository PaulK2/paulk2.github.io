    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I’m a multidisciplinary <strong>ITS Delivery Specialist and Systems Engineer</strong> passionate about connecting
        technology, communication, and design. I’ve worked with enterprise environments at A1, Bosch, and HP, gaining a
        broad technical foundation across IT systems, hardware, and client coordination.
      </p>

      <p>
        My career started in hands-on hardware assembly, progressed through IT support, and grew into system delivery.
        I’ve learned that real success comes from communication between people — not just perfect code or infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        I studied Technical Engineering at the <strong>Technical University of Berlin</strong> (4 semesters) before
        continuing my growth in full-time roles, where I discovered how to combine engineering with creativity and teamwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m now focused on <strong>international technical delivery roles in the UK</strong>, combining analytical thinking,
        cross-cultural communication, and hands-on system experience.
